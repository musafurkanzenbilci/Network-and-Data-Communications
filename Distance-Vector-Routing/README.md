# Distance Vector Routing Algorithm

Implementation of routing algorithm between nodes using the Distance Vector Routing Algorithm in Python.

## Features
- Implements the Distance Vector Algorithm for routing in a network
- Handles dynamic changes in the network topology
- Calculates the shortest path to a destination based on current information
- Can handle multiple paths to a destination and implements load balancing
- Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and monitoring the routing information
- Logs all routing updates and events for later analysis
- Scalable to large networks
- Robust and fault-tolerant design


## Usage

1. (`./runner.sh {test-file}`)
2. `test-file` should be one of `[simple,first,second,third]`
